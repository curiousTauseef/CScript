# CScript

CScript is ...

- An educational tool for learning programming in C
- A *mostly* specifcation compliant implementation of C in JavaScript
- An interesting project in compiler/interpreter design


# Why?

Learning to program online:

- tryruby.org
- codecademy.com
- Nothing for learning C interactively

I need to teach high school students a C based language. 

Available options:

- Deal with platform differences
- Learn an IDE first
- Build an interactive tool

# Implementing C: The Toolbox

- Parser generators
    - CFG vs. PEG
    - Jison vs PEG.js
- Continuations
    - Continuation Passing Style
    - Compiling with continuations
    - CESK machine
- Compiler vs. Interpreter 

# Parser Generators

Context Free Grammars

# PEG Continued 

# Continuations

# Compiler vs. Interpreter


# Challenges

Paradigm shift

- C is imperative
- JavaScript is Object-oriented, Imperative, Functional
